# Wandering-Spirit-Photography_Final_24Nov21

Continuously updated README/journal/notes



***DRAFT/WORKING COPY AS OF 17OCT2021***

This is my first professionally developed website, from design to implementation and to fully operational. 

I took this on as a challenge to my current front-end skills and as a favor for a local business/friend of a friend. 

As of now my front end skills are limited to HTML and CSS. 

I started teaching myself these skills in June of this year. As of now, the only other things in my GitHub Repository are some Front End Mentor challenges I have used to develop myself.

        /*I am taking it live at this point to see how the mobile design is responding*/



*Client Encounters*

I made it very clear to the client/owner that I had never made a professional website and that I was still in the early learning phases of website development and design.

As of me beginning this project the only online presence WSP has is a semi-regularly maintained Facebook page:

                - https://www.facebook.com/search/top?q=wandering%20spirit%20photography


The very first step was to determine the timeline she wanted this completed in. She said she needed it to be completed within the next month (NLT NOV 2021). I was happy with this timeframe. Up to this point I had been able to complete the FEM chalenges overnight in around a 2-8 hour timeframe, depending on the challenge and complexity of the project.

I told her from the start this would be free of charge, minus whatever start-up or domain name fees there may be to actually take the website live.

During our first few conversations she told me about her share drive full of photos and I requested full access so I could gage the skill and style of work she performs. I wanted to see what kind of website I could design with the product the client was putting out.

                - I loved her logo. She has a larger, more wordy logo, that I was able to clip the 'WS' logo from for smaller spaces.
                

As of our last conversations, she has explained that she loves clean adn professional designs and wants her website as such. Her focus as a photographer is to be professional and welcoming to incoming clients.



*Design Process*

My first steps into developing a design for this website was to talk to the client and gauge their online presence.

I then looked at several websites in the same industry in the same city to gauge what others were presenting and what my clients website would be going up against.

                - My first impressions were that local websites were clunky and less professional than what I had in mind. I found some pieces I liked that I wanted to include in this website, but I felt good in my ability to design a website going up against the local competition.
                
  
Lastly I looked at some professional photography websites to see what top performing professionals were using. These became the largest pieces of inspiration for my simple, monochromatic design.

I used Figma to create two different designs with the same core concepts and sent them to her for some final approval and design notes.

Once a desktop design was chosen I developed a quick mobile design for the home page to base my responsive CSS off of.



*Development*

I started with the 'Home' page to ensure I had the responsive measures in place for a smooth transition between desktop and mobile screens.

I am having a lot of trouble with the responsive nav bar as well as the Logo img responsiveness, sizing, and placement.

                - I am afraid I will need to scrap almost 6.5 hours of work to simplify my HTML and CSS, but I believe it would be worth it to have a cleaner/better functioning final product.
                
                
                - I was correct. Although the initial load up onto a mobile device looks exactly as intended, it is not responsive. The heeader does not grow or shrink and the images leave white space at the bottom with the ability to scroll. I will have to revisit height/width and overall resppnsiveness.


After completely starting over I was able to clean up the HTML and CSS. My web page is responsive and fits into vh like I intended it to. CHecking for mobile devices now.

After I had to redo the entire Header portion because of sloppy work, I decided to put a lot more focus and time into my work. I started spending 3-4 hours
a night putting in either design work, research, or physical coding.

I fixed the header and made it fully responsive.

I finally, after probably 4-5 hours, figured out how to do a timed carousel and figured out how keyframes work with animations.

                - I legit probably visited over 50 websites and videos trying to learn how those things actually work.
                
I developed a spacer below the fold with an attention grabber.

I was able to work through the gallery preview grid a little easier than expected. 

                - I knew I was going to be dealing with both landscapes and portraits.
                
                - I finally decided to go through her photographs to try and narrow down what exactly I was going to use.
                          
                          -She couldn't decide from what I had selected.
                          
                - I narrowed it down to either a group of 16 or 21. I wasn't exactly sure how I was going to make them all fit.
                
                - I found a grid generator that allows you to plug and play with CSS grid. It made everything much simpler. 9/10 (UI is meh)
                
Once I had set the grid I started to do some actual design on the website.

                - I started adding splashes of color, design lines, shadows, etc.
                
                - At first this didn't do much, but as I continued to add more  to the page things started to fall into place almost.
                
I was able to knock out the About Me preview, a call to action link to the Contact Page, and the Footer in one sitting.

                - I am very very pleased with both the desktop and mobile layouts and design for the bottom half of this page.
                
                - I even added a little color against her wishes by making the social media icons in the footer reveal a colorful 
                background with their company colors in a gradient design, and it pops so well against the white and gold and black
                all over the page. Very refreshing and fun to create.
                
Once I had the whole page created I went back through and fine tuned the responsiveness.

During my final look through I changed all possible measurements to responsive units and tried to steer away from %'s.

Time to do my soft preview!
